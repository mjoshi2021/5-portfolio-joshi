                    <p>In lacrosse and football teamwork plays a very important role in having a successful team because if the whole team is not working as one there will be no won games. I like to think that I am a good teammate and try and put my teammates before me and help the team and I could bring this same aspect of teammwork into an office someday. </p>

                     <p>In all sports a leader is a very important part of a team. There must always be someone to keep others in check and tell others what to do when they do not know and to help others if they need it. It is an important responsibility on the field and in the workplace as well there must be a leader to drive the group forward which I believe I will be able to do well in the workplace. </p>

                <p>In everything that I ever do there will always be an aspect of humor. I am a humourous person and wether in the workplace, on the field, or in school I like to add humor and jokes into a conversation. Humor is an important thing to lift the spirits of people and can help create a relatioship between others. </p>
